Populism never again. We are going to push forward reforms and envision the country alongside other forces.” — highlighted the President.\n✔️ TMAP — Everything is going according to plan: the new parliamentary balance reinforces the continuity of the economic and political direction, initiating a phase where votes must turn into consensus and concrete results.\n\n📤 Access the full report and discover how the outcome redefines the legislative agenda, the economy, and the power strategy for the upcoming months.\n#Elections2025 #PoliticalAnalysis #ElectoralScenario #Governability #Economy #SPEConsultores #PoliticalIntelligence #ElectoralTrends",
